# credit_scoring 
This repository contains my final project on Udacity nanodegree. In this project, I use a machine learning approach to build credit scoring model that can help upper-management reach their expected approval rate and default rate.  Please see my proposal [here](https://github.com/deviyantiam/credit_scoring/blob/main/proposal.pdf) and my report [here](https://github.com/deviyantiam/credit_scoring/blob/main/report.pdf).
## Introduction
In this project, we will analyse a given historical borrowers data and will use supervised learning techniques to build credit scoring model. Then, we also will decide the threshold of the score or probability to default that can give us default rate below 3% and approval rate higher than 70%. The credit scorecard will also be provided to help nontechnical team use our model aligning with their plan.
