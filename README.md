# credit_scoring 
This repository contains my final project on Udacity nanodegree. In this project, I use a machine learning approach to build credit scoring model that can help upper-management reach their expected approval rate and default rate.  Please see my proposal [here](https://github.com/deviyantiam/credit_scoring/blob/main/proposal.pdf).
